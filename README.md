About the game:  
This is a Javascript based game that is played via  a web browser. The game is designed for two players on a 3x3 grid game board.

Target audience is children aged 3-9 years.

First player represented by X in the script and a gingerbread man visually in the game.
Second player represented by O in the script and a donut visually in the game.

How the game works:
On start, first player (X) selects and clicks in a cell which will be marked by gingerbread man image. Next turn change for second player (O) to select and click in a cell which will be marked by donut image .
When a cell is clicked and the image is placed, that cell becomes inactive and cannot be selected again by either player.
This continues until all cells are filled or a player gets three of their images in a row (horizontal, vertical or diagonal).
The player who placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

If there is no winning pattern selected, it is a draw game.

Result messages will display and hold for 4 seconds for the game to restart, or the player can click the Game Start button to refresh the page starting the new game.

Future enhancements:

 - Score board displays player names, and winning scores
 - Input text for players to type in their names, and names to display on the score board
 - More token for players to choose
 - Refine look and feel to be more appealing to target audience
